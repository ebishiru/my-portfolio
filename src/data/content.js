        ["I thrive on tackling challenges and adapting to new environments—whether it's optimizing strategies in board games or navigating life in a foreign country. With a background in Engineering, I have a strong foundation in problem-solving, always looking for efficient and innovative solutions. My love for strategy extends beyond work, as I enjoy playing and min-maxing board games, refining my ability to think critically and anticipate outcomes."],
        ["Versatility is another defining trait of mine. I took a leap and moved to Japan for almost four years, knowing no one and speaking little of the language.

That experience reinforced my ability to adapt, learn on the fly, and thrive in unfamiliar situations."],
