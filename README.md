To start, I wanted my portfolio to be modern, clean and intuitive to use. I looked up several references but ended up deciding on a tech/futurecore kind of theme.

To make it clean, I wanted each page to have its purpose.
1. Homepage
2. About Me
3. Projects
4. Contact

Each page is self explanatory. The "About" Page can be a bit long, but I tried to keep it to a minimum while still being able to provide keywords that recruiters may look out for. Though it's a futurecore theme, I still wanted to show off my personality and my past, as it might win me brownie points. I merged the technologies with projects since, together they represent all my programming capabilities.

To make things a bit more organized, I initially created a data file to keep all relevant texts and to make updating easier. However, the projects page was hard to keep track of as it required more elements than `p`. I hope to improve on this later, especially when I have more projects to showcase.

Additionally, I went into the project with a mobile first approach. The styling was surprisingly easier to deal with on mobile as there isn't that much content. Instead, a lot of the CSS that took time was making it look good on larger device widths.

## Key things to note

**1. Navbar**

The navigation bar would not only let a user scroll though the pages, but it will be present on every page and let the user know which page they're on.

With just basic color change on `hover` and `active` states, the links go from white to blue. 

I really like animations as it gives it more responsiveness, so I just added one or two in a few areas, without going overboard.

**2. Brands**

The homepage ones will just darken on `hover` but for the "Projects" page, I wanted them to have a bit more explanation incase someone didn't know what they were, or if the logos changed in the future. On `hover` the text will appear beneath and the logo would spin.

I thought I would only have logos on the "Projects" page, so I imported the brands locally. If I end up having to use it on more pages in the future, I will probally import it globally to avoid so many imports.

**3. Form**

I was debating on whether I should add the `form` field since a lot of messaging is done by recruiters on proper mailing platforms. Regardless, it was good experience and knowledge to have and it allowed me to practice `useState` on a website that may not have needed it.
